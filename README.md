This is a simple HTML/Javascript prototype web site to test Sentillion Context methods. The web site consists of three html pages

*  Default.html - This page calls locator and join context

*  Main.html - This uses the rest of the context methods (Set context, Supsend and Resume Context, and Leave context) and handles context
changes from other applications.

* Leave.html - The page that is displayed when a selecting the Leave context button

This web site sample uses only Javascript to communicate with the VerganceLocator Windows service. It does not depend upon .Net or an activeX object.
